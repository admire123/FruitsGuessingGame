Write a Java Console application in which you initialize an arraylist with 10 string 
values. For example, 10 colour names, or fruit names, or vegetable names, or car 
names. Display all the values in the list in a neat tabular format. Randomly select a 
value from the array. Now allow the user 3 chances to guess the value. After the first 
incorrect guess, provide the user with a clue i.e., the first letter of the randomly selected 
word. After the second incorrect guess, provide the user with another clue such as the 
number of letters in the word. When the user correctly guesses the word, remove that 
word from the list. Display the number of items remaining in the list. The user must 
have the option to play again.
